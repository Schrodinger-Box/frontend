# Schrödinger's Box Frontend

**This program is developed during Orbital 2020 and the development has ceased since the end of the event. It is no longer actively maintained.**

This is the frontend web pages of Schrödinger's Box - an event sharing and
publicizing platform targeting students and event organizers within NUS.

This frontend code is written using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript, with few dependencies like jQuery.
